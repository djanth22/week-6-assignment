  Optional
- üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

- Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
- What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
- What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
- What went really well and what could have gone better?

### My Reflection

Looking at the requirements I have achieved:

- I have implemented the useState hook
- I have used useEffect, however I will leave its level of effectiveness to be judged by the individual marking this. However, I do personally think it's been used fairly effectively despite my occasional confusion during this assignment
- jsx has been returned from sources other than the App.jsx
- setInterval has been used to implement a timer that is used as part of the cookies per second.
- the .map() function has been used to render my shop items list
- these shop elements work to allow users to purchase upgrades, achieved using logic.

# what I found difficult

mainly wrapping my head around trying to pass props or functions/values as props to different components so that they could use them. I spent a very long time searching google and youtube trying to understand it better. In the end I made the decision to cut down a couple of the components I had initiually moving them into App.jsx so that I could get done what I needed to. My other main struggle was dealing with the local storage. On my localhost page before deployment nothing seemed to be working, and again ended up searching for some examples of solutions and explanations of how this works in react as opposed to regular oold vanilla javascript. Eventually I admittedly gave up and decided to deploy to render as is.....only to find that the local storage worked just fine (except for a couple of small tweaks that needed to be made). not entirely sure why this happened...but last I checked the render deployment was still working. For both of these major issues it was primarily a lot of playing around, looking at previous assignments to see if similar things may work and code snippets found on stack overflow or similar sites that lead to their resolution.

# extra

personally I wanted to somewhat remake my original cookie clicker, because I wanted to keep things simple. I did have an idea to maybe change elements or make the game much different if I had enough time, but decided keeping it a version 2 of my original cookie clicker would likely work out much better. While I still need to wrap my head around React, I can definitely see its uses and ease for certain things in comparison to vanilla javascript, but i'd say i'll need more time before react and I are friends.
